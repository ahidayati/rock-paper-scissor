# rock-paper-scissor

I coded along a tutorial for a dice game, where a player wins when they have a bigger number than the other player. Then I wanted to practice the simple functions of javascript but with a slightly different version. Therefore, here you go the rock-paper-scissors game!

Note to myself to make it better:
- put a button to play instead of refresh the page
- put input area for players' name, player 1 & player 2 will still be the default name if there is no input
